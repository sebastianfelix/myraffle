= Introduction =

This project was born by the hands of some guys of [http://bh.gtugs.org GTUG-BH]. It's a simple application to raffle numbers, names and items to names with a (hopefully) nice visual appeal. 

Use it if you want to raffle swags on a conference, for example. Or just to play with the airport-like panel.

= Warning =

It was done in a rush, so no support should be expected. In special, it wasn't tested on Internet Explorer.
